# Statistical Inference

This is a repository for the project assignment of the "Statistical Inference" course by Johns Hopkins University.

The project consists of two parts:

1. A [Simulation Exercise](Part1_Simulation.pdf), which investigates the exponential distribution in R of averages of 40 exponentials of a 1000 member sample set and compares it with the Central Limit Theorem;
2. [Basic inferential data analysis](Part2_Basic_Inferential_Data_Analysis.pdf), which analyzes the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

The resulting PDF reports were obtained by processing the two R markdown documents with **knitr** and transforming them into PDF files.

##About the Course

Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, â€¦) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.

The achievements of this course include learning the fundamentals of statistical inference, being able to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and being able to use the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.
