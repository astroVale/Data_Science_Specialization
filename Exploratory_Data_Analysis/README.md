# Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a repository for the project assignments of the Exploratory Data Analysis course by Johns Hopkins University.

The two assignments are in the folders [Course_Project1](/Course_Project1) and [Course_Project2](/Course_Project2), respectively.

##About the Course

This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. In detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics were covered. Some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data were also covered.

The achievements of this course include to be able to make visual representations of data using the base, lattice, and ggplot2 plotting systems in R, apply basic principles of data graphics to create rich analytic graphics from different types of datasets, construct exploratory summaries of data in support of a specific question, and create visualizations of multidimensional data using exploratory multivariate statistical techniques.
