# Reproducible Research: Course Project 2

In this assignment we will analyse the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's storm database to determine which types of severe weather events cause the greatest effects in respect of :

1. population health
2. economic consequences

The NOAA database recognises 48 storm data events (listed in the NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-1605 - AUGUST 17, 2007 publication). The data covers the period from 1950 to 2011, the database comprises a table of 902,297 rows x 37 columns.

We will address the questions in terms of both the total casualties and financial losses incurred over the period and mean casualties and losses per event.

## Instructions:

1. Download the [data set](https://github.com/astroVale/Reproducible_Research/blob/master/PA2/data/repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2) and sore into a folder named "data
2. Extract the data
3. Download the single R markdown [document](PA2.Rmd) that can be processed by knitr and be transformed into an HTML file
4. Process the R markdown document using **knitr**
5. View the output HTML [file](PA2.html)
